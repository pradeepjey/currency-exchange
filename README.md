### âœ… Install Angular CLI
```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

Verify installation:

```bash
node -v   # Expected output: v22.15.0
npm -v    # Verify npm version is installed
```

## Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-angular-app.git
cd currency-exchange
```


## Create Environments

```
1. Create environment folder under src/
 - src/environments/
    â”œâ”€â”€ environment.ts         # Development (default)
    â””â”€â”€ environment.prod.ts 
2. Add following keys
      - production: false, (true for environment.prod.ts)
      - apiBaseUrl: '', // Follow update environment variables section to create
      - fastForexKey:  '' // Follow update environment variables section to create
```

## Update Environment variables

```text
1. Create free(7 days only) or paid account to get apiKey and apiUrl
2. Go to environments/ folder
3. Add apiBaseUrl and fastForexKey
4. Save the information
```

## Install NPM Packages

```bash
npm install
```

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve or npm start
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

# Application Architecture

### Basics

```test
1. Application uses IndexedDB and localstorage to store API fetched information to be passed to view. 
2. There is a polling mechanism involved which updated the stored information every one hour and it can be configured.
3. Incase if you goes offline, application coninute to display stored information from IndexedDB.

```

    actor User
    participant Component as Component/Pages (UI)
    participant Service as Service
    participant Storage as IndexedDB/Localstorage
    participant API as API

    User->>Component: Triggers action (click, submit)
    Component->>Service: Calls service method
    Service->>Storage: Sends data request
    Storage->>API: Sends API request
    API-->>Storage: Returns response/data
    Storage-->>Service: Returns Stored data from DB or Fetched API data
    Service-->>Component: Processes data
    API-->>User: Sees changes
```
